# Overview

The `ath` CLI currently consists of two main components: a task helper and a configuration file. These components allow you to run commands across multiple folders and customize how the tool behaves in your environment.

## Task helper

The task helper allows you to execute commands across multiple nested folders in your current working directory (CWD). You can optionally specify folders to skip or include when running the command.

@tab Abstract Example

```sh
ath fep <<command>> [--skip-foo-bar-baz || --only-gris-gras-gr√§s]
```

@tab Practical Example

Imagine you want to remove node_modules folders in several projects: hello_world, calculatorApp, and any folder with "todo" in its name (like yet-another-todo or my-newest-vue-todo-app). You could run:

```sh
ath fep rm -rf node_modules --only-hello_world-calculatorApp-todo
```

This runs the command only in the specified folders.

## Configuration

You can configure ath to set a default working directory or permanently ignore specific folders. This lets you streamline your workflow by excluding unnecessary directories from command execution.

To find the location of your configuration file, simply run:

```sh
ath pcp
```

::: note
The configuration command syntax is likely to change in the future to improve consistency. For example, it may evolve into something like:

```sh 
ath config <<--setting>>
```

## Help

Need a quick guide? The ath CLI comes with built-in help. Just run:
```sh
ath help
```
